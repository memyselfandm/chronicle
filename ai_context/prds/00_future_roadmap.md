# Future Roadmap: Chronicle Observability Platform

## Overview
This roadmap contains features deferred from the MVP to maintain focus on core functionality. These features represent the evolution from a basic observability tool to a comprehensive development analytics platform.

**Roadmap Principles:**
- Build on proven MVP foundation
- Add complexity incrementally 
- Maintain self-deployment model
- Focus on developer productivity insights

## üîß ADVANCED HOOKS SYSTEM

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Collection

#### Advanced Tool Monitoring
**Rationale**: MVP only captures basic tool usage. This adds deep analytics.
- Pre-tool hooks with parameter capture and context logging
- MCP tool detection and classification (mcp__server__tool pattern matching)  
- Tool usage analytics with execution time tracking and success rate monitoring
- Tool input/output sanitization to remove sensitive data (API keys, passwords)

#### User Interaction Analysis
**Rationale**: MVP captures prompts. This adds behavioral insights.
- Prompt analysis utilities for length, complexity, and intent classification
- Notification tracking for permission requests, idle notifications, and system messages
- Prompt validation and security checking capabilities
- User behavior analytics with session patterns and interaction tracking

#### System Operations Monitoring
**Rationale**: Beyond MVP's basic events, monitor Claude Code's internal operations.
- Context compaction monitoring with before/after analysis
- System performance monitoring with memory usage tracking
- Operational alerts for system issues and performance degradation
- System health checks and diagnostic utilities

### Phase 3: Resilience & Security

#### Database Resilience
**Rationale**: MVP uses Supabase only. Add local fallback for reliability.
- SQLite fallback schema with automatic failover logic
- Database migration scripts and version management system
- Connection pooling and async database operations with proper error handling

#### Security & Privacy Framework
**Rationale**: MVP has basic security. Add enterprise-grade privacy controls.
- Comprehensive data sanitization utilities to detect and remove PII, API keys
- Input validation framework to prevent injection attacks and directory traversal
- Configurable privacy controls with data masking and filtering options
- Audit logging for all hook executions and data access
- Path validation and security scanning for all file operations

#### Installation Automation
**Rationale**: MVP requires manual setup. Automate for easier adoption.
- Automated installation script with dependency management using uv package manager
- Claude Code settings.json template generation and automatic hook registration
- Configuration validation and testing framework with sample data
- Environment detection (dev/prod/local) with appropriate configuration defaults
- Update mechanism for hook scripts and configuration management

## üñ•Ô∏è ADVANCED DASHBOARD FEATURES

### Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience

#### Advanced Design System
**Rationale**: MVP has basic styling. Create professional design system.
- Comprehensive dark theme design system with custom color palette
- Advanced component library (modals, inputs, badges, complex layouts)
- Responsive design system optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Animation system with smooth transitions and loading states

#### Smart Filtering & Search
**Rationale**: MVP has basic filtering. Add powerful search capabilities.
- Multi-select dropdowns for source apps, session IDs, and event types
- Searchable filtering with debounced text search and highlight functionality
- Date range picker with preset options and custom range selection
- Filter persistence with URL state and saved presets
- Advanced filter modal with AND/OR logic and complex filter combinations

#### State Management Evolution
**Rationale**: MVP uses basic React state. Scale with proper state management.
- Zustand store for global state management (events, sessions, filters, UI state)
- SWR data fetching patterns with caching, revalidation, and error handling
- Real-time event processing with batching, debouncing, and memory management
- Connection status monitoring with auto-reconnection and offline handling

### Phase 5: Analytics & Insights

#### Session Analytics Dashboard
**Rationale**: MVP shows basic events. Add productivity insights.
- Session sidebar with active session list and status indicators
- Session metrics dashboard with duration, tool usage, and success rates
- Session comparison functionality with side-by-side analytics
- Session analytics modal with charts for tool distribution and performance trends
- Project context display with git branch, file paths, and environment information

#### Advanced Data Visualization
**Rationale**: MVP shows simple event list. Add rich visualizations.
- Interactive charts using Recharts (pie charts, line charts, area charts, scatter plots)
- Event detail modal with JSON explorer, syntax highlighting, and related events timeline
- File diff viewer for Edit/Write tool operations with syntax highlighting
- Performance visualization with response time trends and percentile analysis
- Custom dashboard creation with drag-and-drop chart builder

#### Data Export & Integration
**Rationale**: MVP is view-only. Add export for external analysis.
- Data export functionality with CSV/JSON formats and current filter application
- API endpoints for external tool integration
- Webhook support for real-time data streaming
- Integration with popular developer tools (GitHub, VS Code, etc.)

#### Advanced Performance Monitoring
**Rationale**: Scale monitoring for production workloads.
- Real-time performance alerts and threshold monitoring
- Advanced caching strategies for large datasets
- Database query optimization and monitoring
- Horizontal scaling support for high-volume deployments

### Phase 7: Enterprise Features
