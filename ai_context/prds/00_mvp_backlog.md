## 🔄 PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY

### Maximum Parallel Development
**2-3 teams can work simultaneously throughout most sprints:**

**Team 1: Backend/Infrastructure**
- Sprint 1: Database schema (H1)
- Sprint 2: Hook architecture (H2)  
- Sprint 3: Hook implementations (H3)

**Team 2: Frontend/UI**
- Sprint 1: Next.js foundation (D1)
- Sprint 2: Supabase integration (D2)
- Sprint 3: Event display components (D3)

**Team 3: Integration/Testing** (joins in Sprint 2)
- Sprint 2: Testing infrastructure setup
- Sprint 3: Component integration testing
- Sprint 4: End-to-end testing and documentation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **H1 (Database) → H2 (Hooks Architecture)**: Database schema must be complete before hook implementation
2. **H1 (Database) → D2 (Dashboard Integration)**: Database must exist before frontend integration
3. **H2 (Hooks Architecture) → H3 (Event Capture)**: Base classes needed before specific hook implementation
4. **D2 (Dashboard Integration) → D3 (Event Display)**: Data layer needed before UI components

### Risk Mitigation
- **Frontend can start immediately** with mock data and basic UI components
- **Database design is critical path** - any delays here impact both tracks
- **Hook architecture is foundational** - invest extra time in Sprint 2 to get this right
- **Integration testing should start early** in Sprint 3 to catch issues quickly

### Sprint Success Criteria

**Sprint 1 Success:**
- Database accepts manual event inserts
- Next.js dev server runs with basic UI
- Both teams can continue work independently

**Sprint 2 Success:**
- BaseHook class successfully connects to database
- Dashboard displays real-time events from database
- Mock events can flow end-to-end

**Sprint 3 Success:**
- All hooks capture events during actual Claude Code usage
- Dashboard shows all event types with proper formatting
- Filtering and modal functionality works correctly

**Sprint 4 Success:** ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Complete MVP works in real user environment ✅ **VALIDATED**
- Installation process takes <30 minutes ✅ **AUTOMATED SETUP SCRIPT**
- System handles normal Claude Code workload without issues ✅ **PERFORMANCE TESTED**
