# Chronicle Hooks UV Single-File Scripts Refactor Backlog (Corrected)

## Critical Context

**This is a corrected version of the backlog after a critical misinterpretation in Sprint 1.**

### What Went Wrong
- **Feature 4** in Sprint 1 was catastrophically misinterpreted
- **Intent**: Extract shared code into library modules that hooks would import (reducing duplication)
- **Implemented**: Inlined all code into each hook (creating massive duplication)
- **Result**: 8 hooks with 500-1100+ lines each, containing 8 different DatabaseManager implementations
- **Impact**: Only 2-3 of 8 hooks actually save to Supabase correctly

### Current State (as of Sprint 7 completion)
- ✅ UV conversion complete (but with wrong architecture)
- ✅ Installation structure works
- ✅ Permission bug fixed
- ✅ Event type mapping implemented
- ❌ 6,000+ lines of duplicated code across hooks
- ❌ Inconsistent DatabaseManager implementations
- ❌ Most hooks fail to save to Supabase
- ❌ Maintenance nightmare (fixes must be applied 8 times)

## Overview

This epic focuses on refactoring the Claude Code hooks system to use UV single-file scripts with **shared library modules** installed in a clean, organized structure. The primary goals are:

1. **Eliminate Installation Clutter**: Replace the current approach that spreads multiple Python files across `.claude` with a clean, self-contained installation
2. **Improve Portability**: Use UV single-file scripts that manage external dependencies while importing shared code from local libraries
3. **Organized Installation Structure**: Install all hooks in a dedicated `chronicle` subfolder under `.claude/hooks/`
4. **Maintain Full Functionality**: Preserve all existing hook capabilities including database connectivity, security validation, and performance monitoring
5. **Simplify Maintenance**: Make hooks easier to install, update, and uninstall through shared libraries
6. **Clean Architecture**: Achieve a maintainable codebase with UV scripts importing from shared libraries
7. **Fix Permission Issues**: Resolve overly aggressive hook behaviors that interfere with Claude Code's auto-approve mode
8. **Eliminate Code Duplication**: One DatabaseManager, one BaseHook, shared by all hooks

## Reference
1. Current hook implementation: `apps/hooks/src/hooks/` (8 files, 500-1100+ lines each)
2. Core dependencies (unused): `apps/hooks/src/core/` (~5,000 lines)
3. Installation script: `apps/hooks/scripts/install.py`
4. Best working implementation: `apps/hooks/src/hooks/post_tool_use.py` (has functional Supabase support)

## Features

### Feature 1: Convert Hooks to UV Single-File Scripts ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Transform each hook script to use UV runtime with proper dependency declarations.

**Status**: ✅ Completed correctly in Sprint 1

**Tasks**:
- [x] Add UV shebang headers and dependency declarations to all 8 hook scripts
- [x] Update hooks to use UV runtime
- [x] Declare external dependencies in UV script metadata
- [x] Test UV execution for all hooks
- [x] Validate performance (<100ms)

### Feature 2: Create Chronicle Subfolder Installation Structure ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Establish a clean, organized installation structure using a dedicated `chronicle` subfolder.

**Status**: ✅ Completed correctly in Sprint 2

**Tasks**:
- [x] Design new directory structure for chronicle subfolder
- [x] Create installation path mapping for all hook files
- [x] Define configuration file placement strategy
- [x] Plan environment variable and settings organization
- [x] Design clean uninstallation process

### Feature 3: Update Installation Process and Settings Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Modify the installation script and settings.json generation to work with the new structure.

**Status**: ✅ Completed correctly in Sprint 2

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update `install.py` to target chronicle subfolder
- [x] Modify settings.json path generation for new structure
- [x] Add UV availability check to installation process
- [x] Create migration logic for existing installations
- [x] Update installation validation to work with UV scripts

### Feature 4: Extract Shared Code to Library Modules ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Extract common functionality into shared library modules that hooks import.

**Status**: ✅ Successfully completed in Sprint 8

**Corrected Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Create `lib/` directory with shared Python modules
- ✅ Use existing standalone DatabaseManager from `src/core/database.py` (more modular than inline versions)
- ✅ Extract BaseHook class for common hook functionality
- ✅ Consolidate utilities to shared modules
- ✅ Hooks import from lib/ directory (NOT inline code)
- ✅ Single source of truth for all shared functionality

**Corrected Tasks**:
- [x] Create `lib/` directory structure in source
- [x] Copy and adapt `src/core/database.py` to `lib/database.py`
- [x] Extract BaseHook class to `lib/base_hook.py` (from post_tool_use.py)
- [x] Create `lib/utils.py` consolidating utilities and env_loader functionality
- [ ] Update installation to copy lib/ to chronicle folder
- [x] Ensure lib/ modules are UV-compatible (no async features hooks don't need)

⚠️ **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**:
The inline DatabaseManager implementations in current hooks contain the **UPDATED** event type mappings from Feature 14 (Sprint 7). The standalone `src/core/database.py` has **OLDER** mappings that will cause regressions. When creating `lib/database.py`, you MUST:
1. Start with `src/core/database.py` for the modular structure
2. **Update all event type mappings** to match the inline versions from hooks
3. Use the correct snake_case event types:
   - `pre_tool_use` (NOT "prompt" or "tool_use")
   - `post_tool_use` (NOT "tool_use")
   - `user_prompt_submit` (NOT "prompt")
   - `session_start`
   - `stop` (NOT "session_end")
   - `subagent_stop`
   - `notification`
   - `pre_compact`
4. Reference the inline hooks (especially `post_tool_use.py`) for the correct implementation
5. Do NOT use deprecated mappings like "prompt", "tool_use", "session_end"

### 🔧 Sprint 9: Installation & Testing Foundation
**Features**: Feature 19, Feature 11
**Rationale**: Ensure the new architecture can be fully installed and tested with simplified configuration.

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- **Sequential Phase 1**: Feature 19 - Environment file simplification (needed before installation updates)
- **Sequential Phase 2**: Feature 11 - Update installation script to copy lib/ directory
- **Sequential Phase 3**: Full end-to-end testing of all hooks with new installation

**Goals**:
- Simplify environment configuration to essentials
- Update installation to copy lib/ directory correctly
- Verify all hooks work with the new installation structure
- Enable comprehensive testing of the repaired architecture

### 📝 Sprint 10: Cleanup & Documentation

- **No Critical Path**: These are optional improvements that don't block anything

**Ideas**:
- Create shared UV package for even better dependency management
- Performance optimizations
- Additional testing tools

## Success Metrics

### Must Have (Sprint 8)
- Each hook reduced from 500-1100+ lines to ~100-200 lines
- Single DatabaseManager implementation shared by all hooks
- All 8 hooks successfully save to Supabase
- All 8 hooks successfully save to SQLite
- Zero code duplication between hooks
- Fix can be applied once and affects all hooks

### Already Achieved
- ✅ Hook installation uses only `chronicle` subfolder
- ✅ All hooks execute in <100ms using UV runtime
- ✅ Installation process completes successfully
- ✅ UV scripts are the only implementation
- ✅ Clean, flat directory structure in `src/hooks/`
- ✅ PreToolUse hook no longer interferes with auto-approve mode
- ✅ 1:1 event type mapping implemented

### Still Needed
- ⏳ Complete functional parity with intended design
- ⏳ All documentation accurately reflects new structure
- ⏳ Installation copies lib/ directory correctly
- ⏳ Clean, minimal .env configuration with only essentials
- ⏳ Professional, configurable logging system
- ⏳ All test/debug code removed from project root

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Current State**: Only 2-3 of 8 hooks work properly - system is largely broken
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Any fix must be applied 8 times currently
3. **Testing Gap**: Cannot properly test until architecture is fixed

### Mitigation Plan
1. Sprint 8 is highest priority - fix architecture immediately
2. Use post_tool_use.py as reference (it works with Supabase)
3. Test each hook thoroughly after repair
4. Document the fix process for future reference

## Lessons Learned

1. **Clear Communication**: "Consolidate" was misinterpreted as "inline" instead of "extract to shared modules"
2. **Early Testing**: Database connectivity issues should have been caught earlier
3. **Code Review**: 500-1100 line files should have been a red flag
4. **Architecture First**: Shared libraries should have been created before hook conversion

## Path Forward

The immediate priority is Sprint 8 to repair the architecture. This will:
1. Reduce codebase by ~80% (from 6,000+ duplicated lines to ~1,200 total)
2. Enable single-point fixes for all hooks
3. Ensure all hooks work with both databases
4. Restore maintainability to the project

Once Sprint 8 is complete, the project will be back on track with a clean, maintainable architecture as originally intended.
