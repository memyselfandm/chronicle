# Chronicle Hooks UV Single-File Scripts Refactor Backlog (Corrected)

## Critical Context

**This is a corrected version of the backlog after a critical misinterpretation in Sprint 1.**

### What Went Wrong
- **Feature 4** in Sprint 1 was catastrophically misinterpreted
- **Intent**: Extract shared code into library modules that hooks would import (reducing duplication)
- **Implemented**: Inlined all code into each hook (creating massive duplication)
- **Result**: 8 hooks with 500-1100+ lines each, containing 8 different DatabaseManager implementations
- **Impact**: Only 2-3 of 8 hooks actually save to Supabase correctly

### Current State (as of Sprint 7 completion)
- ‚úÖ UV conversion complete (but with wrong architecture)
- ‚úÖ Installation structure works
- ‚úÖ Permission bug fixed
- ‚úÖ Event type mapping implemented
- ‚ùå 6,000+ lines of duplicated code across hooks
- ‚ùå Inconsistent DatabaseManager implementations
- ‚ùå Most hooks fail to save to Supabase
- ‚ùå Maintenance nightmare (fixes must be applied 8 times)

## Overview

This epic focuses on refactoring the Claude Code hooks system to use UV single-file scripts with **shared library modules** installed in a clean, organized structure. The primary goals are:

1. **Eliminate Installation Clutter**: Replace the current approach that spreads multiple Python files across `.claude` with a clean, self-contained installation
2. **Improve Portability**: Use UV single-file scripts that manage external dependencies while importing shared code from local libraries
3. **Organized Installation Structure**: Install all hooks in a dedicated `chronicle` subfolder under `.claude/hooks/`
4. **Maintain Full Functionality**: Preserve all existing hook capabilities including database connectivity, security validation, and performance monitoring
5. **Simplify Maintenance**: Make hooks easier to install, update, and uninstall through shared libraries
6. **Clean Architecture**: Achieve a maintainable codebase with UV scripts importing from shared libraries
7. **Fix Permission Issues**: Resolve overly aggressive hook behaviors that interfere with Claude Code's auto-approve mode
8. **Eliminate Code Duplication**: One DatabaseManager, one BaseHook, shared by all hooks

## Reference
1. Current hook implementation: `apps/hooks/src/hooks/` (8 files, 500-1100+ lines each)
2. Core dependencies (unused): `apps/hooks/src/core/` (~5,000 lines)
3. Installation script: `apps/hooks/scripts/install.py`
4. Best working implementation: `apps/hooks/src/hooks/post_tool_use.py` (has functional Supabase support)

## Features

### Feature 1: Convert Hooks to UV Single-File Scripts ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Transform each hook script to use UV runtime with proper dependency declarations.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 1

**Tasks**:
- [x] Add UV shebang headers and dependency declarations to all 8 hook scripts
- [x] Update hooks to use UV runtime
- [x] Declare external dependencies in UV script metadata
- [x] Test UV execution for all hooks
- [x] Validate performance (<100ms)

### Feature 2: Create Chronicle Subfolder Installation Structure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Establish a clean, organized installation structure using a dedicated `chronicle` subfolder.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 2

**Tasks**:
- [x] Design new directory structure for chronicle subfolder
- [x] Create installation path mapping for all hook files
- [x] Define configuration file placement strategy
- [x] Plan environment variable and settings organization
- [x] Design clean uninstallation process

### Feature 3: Update Installation Process and Settings Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Modify the installation script and settings.json generation to work with the new structure.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 2

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update `install.py` to target chronicle subfolder
- [x] Modify settings.json path generation for new structure
- [x] Add UV availability check to installation process
- [x] Create migration logic for existing installations
- [x] Update installation validation to work with UV scripts

### Feature 4: Extract Shared Code to Library Modules ‚ùå TO BE REDONE
**Description**: Extract common functionality into shared library modules that hooks import.

**Original Status**: ‚ùå Catastrophically misimplemented in Sprint 1 (inlined instead of extracted)

**Corrected Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create `lib/` directory with shared Python modules
- Use existing standalone DatabaseManager from `src/core/database.py` (more modular than inline versions)
- Extract BaseHook class for common hook functionality
- Consolidate utilities to shared modules
- Hooks import from lib/ directory (NOT inline code)
- Single source of truth for all shared functionality

**Corrected Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `lib/` directory structure in source
- [ ] Copy and adapt `src/core/database.py` to `lib/database.py`
- [ ] Extract BaseHook class to `lib/base_hook.py` (from post_tool_use.py)
- [ ] Create `lib/utils.py` consolidating utilities and env_loader functionality
- [ ] Update installation to copy lib/ to chronicle folder
- [ ] Ensure lib/ modules are UV-compatible (no async features hooks don't need)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**:
The inline DatabaseManager implementations in current hooks contain the **UPDATED** event type mappings from Feature 14 (Sprint 7). The standalone `src/core/database.py` has **OLDER** mappings that will cause regressions. When creating `lib/database.py`, you MUST:
1. Start with `src/core/database.py` for the modular structure
2. **Update all event type mappings** to match the inline versions from hooks
3. Use the correct snake_case event types:
   - `pre_tool_use` (NOT "prompt" or "tool_use")
   - `post_tool_use` (NOT "tool_use")
   - `user_prompt_submit` (NOT "prompt")
   - `session_start`
   - `stop` (NOT "session_end")
   - `subagent_stop`
   - `notification`
   - `pre_compact`
4. Reference the inline hooks (especially `post_tool_use.py`) for the correct implementation
5. Do NOT use deprecated mappings like "prompt", "tool_use", "session_end"

### Feature 5: Database Configuration and Environment Management ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Ensure database connectivity and environment variable management work seamlessly.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 3 (though hampered by Feature 4 error)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update environment variable loading for chronicle subfolder
- [x] Test database connectivity from UV single-file scripts
- [x] Validate Supabase integration with new script structure
- [x] Ensure SQLite fallback works in chronicle folder
- [x] Test database schema creation and migration

### Feature 6: Testing and Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**Description**: Comprehensive testing of the UV single-file script system.

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing revealed only 2-3 hooks work with Supabase

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create test suite for UV single-file scripts
- [x] Validate end-to-end hook execution
- [x] Performance test new scripts under load
- [x] Test database connectivity (**FAILED - only 2-3 hooks work**)
- [x] Validate error handling

### Feature 7: Documentation and Examples Update ‚è≥ PENDING

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update main README with new installation instructions
- [ ] Document chronicle subfolder structure and organization
- [ ] Write migration guide for existing installations
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide with UV-related issues

### Feature 8: Remove Inline Code Duplication ‚ùå WRONG APPROACH
**Description**: This feature doubled down on the wrong approach from Feature 4.

**Status**: ‚ùå Completed but needs to be undone

**Note**: This feature made the problem worse by further entrenching inline code. Will be reversed by Feature 15.

### Feature 9: Consolidate Hook Scripts to Single Location ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Move UV scripts from `src/hooks/uv_scripts/` to `src/hooks/`.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 6

### Feature 10: Remove UV Suffix from Script Names ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Rename all hook scripts to remove the `_uv` suffix.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 6

### Feature 11: Update Installation Script for Clean Structure ‚è≥ PENDING
**Description**: Modify install.py to work with the new simplified structure.

**Status**: ‚è≥ Needs update to copy lib/ directory

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update hooks_source_dir path to point to `src/hooks/`
- [ ] Add lib/ directory copying logic
- [ ] Ensure lib/ is accessible to hooks at runtime
- [ ] Update settings.json hook path generation
- [ ] Test installation process end-to-end

### Feature 12: Update Documentation for Clean Structure ‚è≥ PENDING
**Description**: Update all documentation to reflect the new simplified structure.

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Feature 13: Fix PreToolUse Hook Permission Bug ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Fix the overly aggressive permission management in the preToolUse hook.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 4

### Feature 14: Implement 1:1 Event Type Mapping ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Description**: Establish a 1:1 mapping between hook event names and database event types.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed correctly in Sprint 7

### Feature 15: Repair Hook Implementations üÜï NEW
**Description**: Remove inline code duplication and update hooks to use shared libraries. This is largely overlapping with Feature 4 tasks but focused on the hook-side changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All hooks import from shared lib/ modules
- Each hook reduced from 500-1100+ lines to ~100-200 lines
- Consistent DatabaseManager across all hooks
- All hooks successfully save to Supabase
- All hooks successfully fallback to SQLite
- No duplicated code between hooks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove inline DatabaseManager from all 8 hooks
- [ ] Update hooks to import from lib/database
- [ ] Remove inline BaseHook code from hooks
- [ ] Update hooks to extend lib/base_hook.BaseHook
- [ ] Remove all other duplicated inline code
- [ ] Test each hook for proper imports
- [ ] Verify all hooks save to both databases

**Note**: These tasks run in parallel with Feature 4 - Feature 4 creates the lib/ modules, Feature 15 updates hooks to use them.

### Feature 16: Fix Database Connectivity Issues üÜï NEW
**Description**: Ensure all hooks properly save events to both Supabase and SQLite.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 8 hooks successfully save to Supabase
- Session creation works consistently
- No 400 Bad Request errors
- SQLite fallback works for all hooks
- Event types are consistent across all hooks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix session creation logic for all hooks
- [ ] Resolve Supabase 400 errors (session_id UUID issues)
- [ ] Ensure consistent event_type usage
- [ ] Test all hooks with real Claude Code sessions
- [ ] Verify data appears in both databases
- [ ] Add error logging for debugging

## Sprint Plan

### ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Core Script Conversion **COMPLETED** (with critical error)
**Features**: Feature 1 ‚úÖ, Feature 4 ‚ùå (misimplemented)
**Status**: UV conversion successful, but Feature 4 was catastrophically misinterpreted. Instead of extracting to shared libraries, all code was inlined into each hook.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 2: Installation Infrastructure **COMPLETED**
**Features**: Feature 2 ‚úÖ, Feature 3 ‚úÖ
**Status**: Successfully implemented chronicle subfolder structure and installation process.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 3: Database Integration and Testing **COMPLETED** (partially failed)
**Features**: Feature 5 ‚úÖ, Feature 6 ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: Database configuration works, but testing revealed only 2-3 hooks actually save to Supabase due to Sprint 1's error.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 4: Critical Bug Fix **COMPLETED**
**Features**: Feature 13 ‚úÖ
**Status**: Successfully fixed PreToolUse permission bug.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 5: Code Cleanup **COMPLETED** (wrong direction)
**Features**: Feature 8 ‚ùå
**Status**: This sprint made the problem worse by further inlining code instead of extracting it.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 6: Structure Simplification **COMPLETED**
**Features**: Feature 9 ‚úÖ, Feature 10 ‚úÖ
**Status**: Successfully consolidated hooks and removed UV suffix.

### ‚úÖ Sprint 7: Event Type Mapping **COMPLETED**
**Features**: Feature 14 ‚úÖ
**Status**: Successfully implemented 1:1 event type mapping.

### üîß Sprint 8: Architecture Repair **NEW - CRITICAL**
**Features**: Feature 4 (corrected), Feature 15, Feature 16
**Rationale**: Emergency sprint to fix the architecture disaster from Sprint 1. This is the most critical work.

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- **Sequential Phase 1**: Feature 4 - Create lib/ directory and extract shared modules (prerequisite for other work)
- **Parallel Phase 2**: Once lib/ exists:
  - Developer A: Feature 15 - Update 4 hooks to use shared libraries (notification, post_tool_use, pre_tool_use, user_prompt_submit)
  - Developer B: Feature 15 - Update other 4 hooks to use shared libraries (session_start, stop, subagent_stop, pre_compact)
  - Developer C: Feature 16 - Fix database connectivity issues in parallel as hooks are updated
- **Sequential Phase 3**: Integration testing of all hooks together

**Note on Feature Overlap**: Feature 4 creates the shared libraries, Feature 15 modifies hooks to use them. They work together as two sides of the same architectural repair.

**Goals**:
- Extract shared code to lib/ modules
- Remove 6,000+ lines of duplicated code
- Fix all database connectivity issues
- Ensure all 8 hooks work properly

### üìù Sprint 9: Installation & Documentation Updates
**Features**: Feature 11, Feature 7, Feature 12
**Rationale**: Update installation and documentation to reflect the corrected architecture.

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- **Parallel Work Streams**:
  - Stream 1: Feature 11 - Update installation script to copy lib/ directory
  - Stream 2: Feature 7 - Update main documentation and examples
  - Stream 3: Feature 12 - Update structure documentation
- **No Dependencies**: All three features can proceed independently
- **Integration Point**: Final review to ensure consistency across all documentation

**Goals**:
- Update installation to copy lib/ directory
- Complete all documentation updates
- Create migration guide

### üöÄ Sprint 10: Optional Enhancements
**Features**: Future enhancements from original Feature 6 in 03_hook_script_cleanup_backlog.md
**Rationale**: Once core architecture is fixed, consider additional optimizations.

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- **Independent Explorations**: Each enhancement can be explored separately
- **No Critical Path**: These are optional improvements that don't block anything

**Ideas**:
- Create shared UV package for even better dependency management
- Performance optimizations
- Additional testing tools

## Success Metrics

### Must Have (Sprint 8)
- Each hook reduced from 500-1100+ lines to ~100-200 lines
- Single DatabaseManager implementation shared by all hooks
- All 8 hooks successfully save to Supabase
- All 8 hooks successfully save to SQLite
- Zero code duplication between hooks
- Fix can be applied once and affects all hooks

### Already Achieved
- ‚úÖ Hook installation uses only `chronicle` subfolder
- ‚úÖ All hooks execute in <100ms using UV runtime
- ‚úÖ Installation process completes successfully
- ‚úÖ UV scripts are the only implementation
- ‚úÖ Clean, flat directory structure in `src/hooks/`
- ‚úÖ PreToolUse hook no longer interferes with auto-approve mode
- ‚úÖ 1:1 event type mapping implemented

### Still Needed
- ‚è≥ Complete functional parity with intended design
- ‚è≥ All documentation accurately reflects new structure
- ‚è≥ Installation copies lib/ directory correctly
- ‚è≥ Migration guide for users

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Current State**: Only 2-3 of 8 hooks work properly - system is largely broken
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Any fix must be applied 8 times currently
3. **Testing Gap**: Cannot properly test until architecture is fixed

### Mitigation Plan
1. Sprint 8 is highest priority - fix architecture immediately
2. Use post_tool_use.py as reference (it works with Supabase)
3. Test each hook thoroughly after repair
4. Document the fix process for future reference

## Lessons Learned

1. **Clear Communication**: "Consolidate" was misinterpreted as "inline" instead of "extract to shared modules"
2. **Early Testing**: Database connectivity issues should have been caught earlier
3. **Code Review**: 500-1100 line files should have been a red flag
4. **Architecture First**: Shared libraries should have been created before hook conversion

## Path Forward

The immediate priority is Sprint 8 to repair the architecture. This will:
1. Reduce codebase by ~80% (from 6,000+ duplicated lines to ~1,200 total)
2. Enable single-point fixes for all hooks
3. Ensure all hooks work with both databases
4. Restore maintainability to the project

Once Sprint 8 is complete, the project will be back on track with a clean, maintainable architecture as originally intended.
