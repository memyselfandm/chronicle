# Chronicle Hooks UV Single-File Scripts Refactor Backlog

## Overview

This epic focuses on refactoring the Claude Code hooks system to use UV single-file scripts installed in a clean, organized structure. The primary goals are:

1. **Eliminate Installation Clutter**: Replace the current approach that spreads multiple Python files across `.claude` with a clean, self-contained installation
2. **Improve Portability**: Use UV single-file scripts that manage their own dependencies without requiring complex import paths
3. **Organized Installation Structure**: Install all hooks in a dedicated `chronicle` subfolder under `.claude/hooks/`
4. **Maintain Full Functionality**: Preserve all existing hook capabilities including database connectivity, security validation, and performance monitoring
5. **Simplify Maintenance**: Make hooks easier to install, update, and uninstall

## Reference
1. Current hook implementation: `apps/hooks/src/hooks/`
2. Core dependencies analysis: `apps/hooks/src/core/`
3. Installation script: `apps/hooks/scripts/install.py`

## Features

### Feature 1: Convert Hooks to UV Single-File Scripts

- [ ] Define configuration file placement strategy
- [ ] Plan environment variable and settings organization
- [ ] Design clean uninstallation process

### Feature 3: Update Installation Process and Settings Configuration

**Description**: Modify the installation script and settings.json generation to work with the new chronicle subfolder structure and UV single-file scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Install script creates `chronicle` subfolder automatically
- Settings.json uses correct paths pointing to chronicle subfolder
- Hook paths use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/chronicle/` format
- Installation validates UV availability before proceeding
- Backward compatibility with existing installations is maintained

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update `install.py` to target chronicle subfolder
- [ ] Modify settings.json path generation for new structure
- [ ] Add UV availability check to installation process
- [ ] Create migration logic for existing installations
- [ ] Update installation validation to work with UV scripts

### Feature 4: Consolidate Core Dependencies

**Description**: Analyze and consolidate the ~5,000 lines of core dependencies into the minimal essential functionality needed by each hook script.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Essential database connectivity is preserved in each hook
- Security validation functions are maintained
- Performance monitoring capabilities are retained
- Error handling and logging remain functional
- Total code footprint per hook is reasonable (<500 lines including inline deps)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Audit core dependencies to identify essential vs. optional functionality ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create consolidated database client for inline use ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Simplify security validation to core requirements ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Streamline error handling and logging for inline use ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Optimize performance monitoring for single-file context ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Feature 5: Database Configuration and Environment Management

**Description**: Ensure database connectivity and environment variable management work seamlessly with the new UV single-file script structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Scripts can read database configuration from `.env` file in chronicle folder
- Supabase connectivity works from UV scripts
- SQLite fallback functions properly
- Environment variables are loaded correctly
- Database schema initialization works with new structure

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update environment variable loading for chronicle subfolder
- [ ] Test database connectivity from UV single-file scripts
- [ ] Validate Supabase integration with new script structure
- [ ] Ensure SQLite fallback works in chronicle folder
- [ ] Test database schema creation and migration

### Feature 6: Testing and Validation

**Description**: Comprehensive testing of the new UV single-file script system to ensure all functionality works correctly and performance requirements are met.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All hooks execute successfully with UV runtime
- Database writes complete successfully from new scripts
- Performance remains under 100ms execution time
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Integration with Claude Code works properly

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create test suite for UV single-file scripts
- [ ] Validate end-to-end hook execution with real Claude Code sessions
- [ ] Performance test new scripts under load
- [ ] Test database connectivity and data writing
- [ ] Validate error handling and recovery scenarios

### Feature 7: Documentation and Examples Update

**Description**: Update all documentation, examples, and troubleshooting guides to reflect the new UV single-file script structure and installation process.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Installation documentation reflects new chronicle subfolder approach
- Examples show correct UV script usage
- Troubleshooting guide covers UV-specific issues
- README files are updated with new structure information
- Migration guide is provided for existing users

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update main README with new installation instructions
- [ ] Create UV single-file script usage examples

## Sprint Plan

### ✅ Sprint 1: Core Script Conversion **COMPLETED**
**Features**: Feature 1 (Convert Hooks to UV Single-File Scripts) ✅, Feature 4 (Consolidate Core Dependencies) ✅
**Rationale**: These features work together to create the foundation of self-contained scripts. Converting to UV format and consolidating dependencies must happen together for consistency.
**Status**: All 8 hook scripts successfully converted to UV single-file format. Core dependencies consolidated from ~5,000 lines to ~1,500 lines optimized for inline use. Performance targets achieved (<100ms execution). Zero external import dependencies.

### Sprint 2: Installation Infrastructure
**Features**: Feature 2 (Create Chronicle Subfolder Installation Structure), Feature 3 (Update Installation Process and Settings Configuration)
**Rationale**: Installation structure and process updates can proceed in parallel with script conversion. These changes don't conflict with Sprint 1 work.

### Sprint 3: Database Integration and Testing
**Features**: Feature 5 (Database Configuration and Environment Management), Feature 6 (Testing and Validation)
**Rationale**: Database integration and testing depend on completion of previous sprints. These can proceed in parallel once the foundation is established.

### Sprint 4: Documentation and Finalization
**Features**: Feature 7 (Documentation and Examples Update)
**Rationale**: Documentation updates should happen after all functionality is implemented and tested. This ensures documentation reflects the final working system.
