```

## Generation

Badges are automatically generated by:

1. **CI Pipeline**: On every push and PR
2. **Local Development**: Run `npm run coverage:badges`
3. **Manual**: Run coverage scripts individually

## Colors

- **Green**: Coverage meets or exceeds threshold
- **Yellow**: Coverage 80-99% of threshold  
- **Orange**: Coverage 60-79% of threshold
- **Red**: Coverage below 60% of threshold

The badges update automatically when coverage changes.
