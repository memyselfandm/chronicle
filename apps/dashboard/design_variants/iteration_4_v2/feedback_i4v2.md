Variation 1:
Okay, looking at variant one. Not a lot stands out in this one. The collapsible project folders in the sidebar are good. Other than that, I think there's still some broken CSS here in the event feed for the selects. But here and over there, I guess. But yeah, not a lot stands out about variation one.

Variation 2:
Variation 2: Still some broken CSS for the activity timeline. I don't like the sidebar. Interesting that it incorporated a tooltip for keyboard shortcuts, which I didn't really ask for. The iconography and the shape of the icons in this activity timeline are some of the best of all the designs. I also like the color coding in the event feed. It's pretty good, but I think it's having a little issue with the indentation and getting the columns lined up. I like to see probably some more space between the columns would help that. And it's using the width of this table more rather than compacting everything, trying to compact everything to the left there's a lot of space on the right side of this table that's unused. Don't really like the sidebar in this variant.

Variation 3:
So okay variant 3. Actually iconography in the timeline view here is really good. It's really similar to the first variant. Like that it incorporated all the feedback in collapsing the filter view. The only thing I would say is that the rest of the sidebar should move up when that filter view is collapsed. So having the projects start right under there instead of the filters still being a fixed size container.

Also, where the filters show up when you select them (above the filter dropdown) is like I think I had this feedback and another design where the filter, currently selected filters is disconnected from the filter view visual, like it's on a different part of the page. So I'm not sure how I handled that. I don't really like that.

Um, so yeah but like this sidebar is pretty good. I think this design overall does a really good job of incorporating most of the feedback. Like the timeline or the event feed is color-coded with color-coded um it doesn't have indentation. Like it would be nice to see the indentation in here but it has a table header um also doesn't have filters um but I guess it's got the big sort of filter view in the sidebar so that's fine. But like overall this variant is the most comprehensive even though there are some elements of it that are not quite on the mark. But like this is probably the most comprehensively close out of all of them.

Variation 4:
I don't know if it's supposed to work, but it doesn't. There's nothing in here. There's really nothing in here. There's no data streaming through, and some of the CSS is broken. So I think there's probably some issues with this one. The header does look good, though. It's supposed to have that little throughput mini graph, but it's not working because the data is not feeding in. See reading add event listener. Yeah, I think it's just there's something wrong with the JavaScript for this variant.
Variation 4, I had the agent go back and fix the JavaScript. I see events loading. The event feed table actually looks good. The timeline still doesn't load any data. The sidebar is still broken, where the projects are stacked on top of each other. But the event feed is actually good - it's got some intentional color coding in it. And it's very readable and scannable.Also, the header in variation 4 is one of the best headers in terms of how all the data is organized and visually presented.

Variation 5:
Variation 5v1 is pretty similar, I guess it fixed the timeline, and now that it's fixed, I don't like it because it's just a bunch of colored boxes, and I'm not really sure what they mean. They don't have any icons or anything, just little colored rectangles flipping around on the screen. This is another one where I think that almost all the other variants did the components better in this one.

Variation 6:
OK, finally we got variation 6. It's got a little tool tip here, "here and now". It's got the static filters. It still has the compact view button, which it should not have in the sidebar. The sidebar should just be compact. Got the pre-made filters, which is interesting. I think the pre-made filters is good for MVP, and then the filters from variant 3, the more comprehensive filters from variant 3. That would be a good next iteration on that. But the pre-made filter is actually kind of cool. I just want to see them more condensed visually in this sidebar. But I think that's just like a CSS and styling thing. The header on this variant looks good. The activity timeline, I don't like the icons. Like just don't they don't look good and it's kind of hard to understand what's happening here. I think this also may be a case where some of the CSS is broken here because the time stamps for the activity timeline are not aligned very well. So there is that. The event feed, just kind of meh. Like I think that most of the other or some of the other variants that I talked about did this event feed better.
