Variant 1:
OK. Variant 1: The header is solid so this is using a like with the static side a fixed sidebar and then OK so the activity timeline can be condensed I think I like that. I think I like that. It's also using real data so that looks good. Yeah, I like the notifications. I like the information that's provided in the like I'm looking at the sidebar awaiting input like the information that's provided there and then I see active sessions also in like its own container and then idle Honestly, I feel like having three light containers in the sidebar. I don't know if I like that. I would rather them just all be sort of listed and then kind of dynamically have the order be like dynamically adjusted or they're just in like alphabetical order or something like that just in some order and then use color to you know indicate something needs input or it's active or its idle. Like this kind of three different containers in the sidebar plus it also has an option for filtering so like that filtering option could be used. Like to filter between active and idle. So yeah, that part I don't like about the sidebar but overall sidebar is pretty good. Okay so then going to activity timeline better This is a better view of the swim lanes. Um The as design is really wonky and like it's using the letters but like there I know there's like some extra letters in here. It's like t times five I think it's trying to say like multiple the way that it's trying to indicate multiple tool uses is not great. It's not very readable and it's kind of throwing the whole design off but I guess if I ignore that Um It's not too bad. Um I still don't know if I really like the letters. Um But again, like if those were like material icons and like glancable, I could like if it was easy for me to know you know what each one of these little boxes was based on the icon that would be better. Uh so yeah going down to the event feed um Events tools notifications okay so then those are those pills are all um Pills are all selectable Yeah okay so I like that um I like that uh some kind of icon over here I'm not really sure what it does. I don't know if it's supposed to be like turning on it kind of looks like it would turn on indentation but it doesn't do anything when I click it um but yeah color coding in the feed is good. Um All that like all the data in the feed is good. Um It's got the pre tool use and post tool use in here. Um Uh I I can't tell if it's like trying to group them together but I Like ideally these like life again like life cycle events would be kind of like grouped together into one event with the like sub events under it um and then there's like a connected kind of floating indicator here. I do not Like that Um I liked it a lot better when it was Like some sort of status indicator that was like next to the event feed or or in the main header.

Variant 2:
Okay, looking at variant 2. This is the sidebar? Oh, okay. Interesting.

Starting from the top, yes, the Connection Status indicator in the header here is definitely the right pattern for connection status data to the right. Like this looks really good in terms of the header sidebar. So what is this doing? Okay, so this sidebar is actually grouping the sessions by project, which I like. That is solid. And then you've just got the two containers here, like a waiting input. Like sitting kind of fixed at the top, and then you've got your projects with all the sessions, and I can see it's got like an indented subtask going on here, file analysis, that's really cool. Yeah, that's I bars nice. I would think like it if you could close the sidebar sidebar though. Yeah, I think having the sidebar be toggleable would be good.

Okay, so then going to the timeline view. Okay, so I got swim lanes. And then this is visually interesting. So that's okay, I have like a pro like one instance of it. It's got the folder or the branch actually, which is cool. And then it's using icons. I like the iconography here. The icons are kind of like moving left to right. It's like they're moving across the feed. And I don't really understand what that's indicating. Um, I guess. Okay, so this is like, for each project. That may be multiple instances, and like the tasks are just like moving through. I see that the subagent is represented here. Um, yeah, like I don't know this. It's close. It's really close. It's just that I don't think I fully understand what I'm looking at in the timeline. But like conceptually, I think it's really close to where it needs to be for this kind of feed.Okay, so then looking at the filters in this timeline. This does not let me do multi-select. Nope. Okay, so I'll switch over to the event feed. Showing events okay, so that's there. Okay, okay. So then in the event feed, I have to select a project from the sidebar. So that was not immediately clear, which I think is could maybe use some direction. And then also being able to select the project from the event feed without having to go to the sidebar would be nice. But okay, so looking at the actual event feed itself, there's no live data streaming into here which is fine. Yeah, this is actually pretty good. It doesn't use color coding; it's much more muted. But it does use icons and indentation. I think the layout here is really good. These little spinning hourglasses that indicate what task is currently running are cool. Yeah, I dig that. Actually, let me see what does this look like? Yep, oh yep, and then you can go into a sub-agent as well. Yeah, that's pretty good actually I dig that.

Variant 3:
Oh, OK. Oh. OK, I'm looking at version three. There's a lot of animation going on in the event feed. The activity flow, something's off about the design, about the CSS or something here. It's kind of broken. Oh wait, there it is. It just came back in somehow. OK. Yeah, I don't like the animation or the way the events are coming in. Again, events are happening very quickly, so that animation would just be flickering all the time. Negative. There's also no header that I can see (again, maybe the CSS is broken). There's no header that I can see here. The sidebar is just like little dots. Oh, and you can see radio buttons actually. Yeah, not a fan of that of just the dots because you can't really tell what's what without hovering over everything, and if you have like 20 of these it'd be really hard to sort. The activity flow, I have no idea what's happening here. It's all like very very small and I don't know if that design is broken. It kind of gives me the option to zoom. And then there's some notifications require input confirmation and OK that's interesting. Yeah, I'm OK with the hovering notifications, but I don't know, some of the other variants also did notifications for input pretty well without having the toast notifications, so yeah, I don't think I really like variant three at all. This. I know, yeah, it's not good, I don't understand it.

Variant 4:
Okay, variant four. So this is the first of the variants without the sidebar. Okay, so this is trying to put the sessions at the top. Which could actually work. If it was more the like Omni search bar kind of deal, maybe not even like search, but like just more like an Omni bar where you had maybe not actually because I think I'd want to see as many sessions as possible. Yeah, it's consolidating the sessions horizontally is tricky but okay so moving on though you got this next section - two sessions awaiting input. Which you can click on it and then filter see event feed which is cool I can also close that if I wanted to. Then a activity timeline again I don't really understand the animation like there's things that are just kind of like moving across this timeline there like animating themselves into the timeline in like random places. I don't know if that I don't know if this makes sense. I don't I don't think I really understand it but like in terms of the swim lanes and like the iconography this is good like it's color coded it's using icons the swim lanes. Some lanes are good. I think they could actually be a little bit tighter but you know maybe if this if this had some kind of like branching for sub-agents or something like that then maybe this height makes sense for the swim lane but otherwise tighter. Event feed good. I think some of the other variants of the event feed better. Also this is not consistently colored oh because it's running the type is not color-coded when it's running that's this is weird yeah I don't know there's not a nothing is like super exciting about this design variant maybe other than some of the color coding and like iconography in the activity timeline.

Variant 5:
Okay, moving on to variant 5. This one takes the sessions and puts them inside a fixed-size container so that it scrolls. I guess this is probably the best pattern for this. I feel like each one of these session cards could be a lot smaller, a lot smaller and more condensed for this view, so that you could fit more of these little cards across. If they were thinner like this, it would just be a lot easier to read or a lot easier to contain without maybe even without having a scroll situation. Like, if this was 5x4, that's 20 individual sessions that you could fit in here at the top of the screen, and that's like maybe not so egregious.

Moving on to activity timeline. This activity timeline is not really doing anything; it's just like kind of color blocks which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Then we've got the event feed with some indentation in the event feed which I like. Other than that, it's good, it's got color coding, the tool is kind of in the pill form which is neat, uh, it's just visually nice, but again, nothing really stands out here that hasn't been done in any of the other designs.

Variant 6:
Okay, variant six. Okay, so this one has a key which is nice. I think that the time markers to CSS and the time markers is broken but there's supposed to be time markers across the top of here. For this event feed, okay so then the, the visual feed is in a fixed container. So you can scroll down. It doesn't look like you can filter it. But in terms of like the swim lane and the way the icons are laid out in the swim lane, like this is probably one of the better swim lanes. Like if these were, if these icons were material icons and not emojis, like I think this layout for the swim lane is probably the closest to what I'm thinking of. And then there's like a little bit of wonkiness here and like the sizing of some of these little things um, and the overlap is also tricky like I liked in one of the variants they were-the little boxes were a little bit more transparent like the visual language from that variant um I think it was variant two or variant four I can't remember but they had like transparent icons like icon boxes for this and it was that was solid um I like the indentation for the sub-agent here that's nice um so yeah as is pretty close um again there's no live data flowing through here so I don't know exactly what I'm looking at. But I like that there's a key um and I know that those are the things that I would put in the key like tool activity yes uh I don't know if awaiting input is maybe right for a key. Tool activity sub-agent um I would maybe have some different categories for how everything is color coded but yeah okay. Okay so then event feed um pretty standard event feed there's some stuff that's like indented there's some color coding like yeah that's it's not bad just a little visual variation using like rounded pills here um but like not much different than the event feeds I think the most of the agents most of the variations have the event feed like pretty, pretty mailed down. This one doesn't have the multi-select for the event feed which I don't like but other than that like pretty good.
