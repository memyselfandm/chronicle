# Chronicle Dashboard - Iteration 2, Variant 3

## Horizontal Timeline Visualization

This variant focuses on visualizing prompt cycles and tool patterns using a horizontal timeline interface. It addresses the key feedback from iteration 1 by emphasizing visual prompt cycles, dense event information, and scalable design for multiple Claude Code instances.

## Key Features

### Horizontal Timeline
- **Visual Prompt Cycles**: Each cycle displayed as connected blocks showing user_prompt → tools → stop flow
- **Tool Sequence Visualization**: Icons representing tool chains within cycles (Bash, Read, Write, Grep, Edit)
- **Duration Indicators**: Visual duration display for completed cycles
- **Nested Sub-agent Cycles**: Purple indicators showing sub-agent activity count
- **Time Scale Zoom**: 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m time scale controls

### Dense Event Feed
- **Compact Event Rows**: High-density information display with tool names visible
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of events with auto-scroll capability
- **Dropdown Filters**: Event type and instance filtering
- **Status Indicators**: Success, pending, and error states

### Instance Monitoring
- **Track-based Layout**: Each Claude Code instance gets its own timeline track
- **Status Visualization**: Active (▶) vs waiting (⏸) states
- **Scalable Design**: Supports 10-30+ instances efficiently

## Visual Design

### Dark Theme
- Primary background: `#0a0a0a`
- Secondary background: `#141414`
- Accent colors for different event types and tools
- High contrast for readability in development environments

### Iconography
- **Cycle Start/End**: Colored dots indicating prompt cycle boundaries
- **Tool Icons**: Single-letter icons with color coding (B=Bash, R=Read, W=Write, etc.)
- **Status Indicators**: Geometric symbols for quick visual scanning
- **Sub-agent Badges**: Purple circular indicators with count

## Mock Data

The dashboard includes realistic mock data showing:
- **Complete Cycles**: Full user_prompt → tool_sequence → stop flows
- **Incomplete Cycles**: Ongoing cycles awaiting completion
- **Error States**: Failed cycles with error indicators
- **Sub-agent Activity**: Nested agent operations within cycles
- **Tool Patterns**: Common tool usage sequences (Read→Edit→Write, Bash→Grep, etc.)

## Interactive Features

### Timeline Controls
- **Pause/Resume**: Freeze timeline updates for analysis
- **Time Scale**: Zoom between 1-minute and 30-minute views
- **Instance Filtering**: Focus on specific Claude Code instances

### Event Management
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatic scrolling to latest events
- **Event Filtering**: Filter by event type (user_input, tool_use, agent_response, error)
- **Hover Details**: Extended information on hover

## Performance Optimizations

- **Event Limiting**: Display last 100 events maximum
- **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal DOM updates for smooth performance
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old events
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies for fast loading
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsive design
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Modular event handling system
- **Mock Data Generator**: Realistic simulation of Chronicle events

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use time scale controls to adjust timeline granularity
3. Filter events and instances using dropdown controls
4. Pause timeline for detailed analysis
5. Observe prompt cycles and tool patterns in the horizontal timeline

This variant emphasizes productivity monitoring and agent unblocking over pattern analysis, making it ideal for development workflows with multiple Claude Code instances.
