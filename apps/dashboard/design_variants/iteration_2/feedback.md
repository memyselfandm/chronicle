Variant 1:
All right, let's have a look at variant one.

Starting from the top, the header is very condensed, which I really like. It does not have a connection status indicator, which honestly is fine, like the live event feed kind of indicates that it's connected. 

Going down, I really overall like how tight this is. The session cards are also really tight. I'm not really sure what the resume button is supposed to do there because this is not really a control interface; it's more of a monitoring interface. 

The interesting thing about having the sessions prominently is that they can then be used as a filter so you could click one and then it would be a filter for the activity stream and vent feed. But I don't know if this is better done somewhere else in the interface. The information in the header is really nice: active sessions, ones awaiting input, total number of events. That's that's nice. I kind of feel like the sessions could be like almost an ephemeral area, almost like notifications. Any session that's awaiting input will show up there, and the user could click on that notification or click on that session card to see what is awaiting input. If they wanted to do that, or it would just be enough information that they could go to their terminal and get to that Cloud Code session directly to see what's going on and address it. 

Moving down to the activity overview. This I understand where it's taking the feedback and the direction they're trying to take it in. I don't think this nails it. It's kind of like a. Yeah, it's showing the number of events so like two. It's got like this bar graph and my tool usage search, which is like not really interesting. I really wanted this area to be like a horizontal stream, a timeline thing that is showing the activity over time. 

I like the subagents in here, not really sure what any of these icons mean (FM is maybe file manager). Not really sure what that means, but the hierarchy would be like session subagents and then like tool usage and that's just a hierarchy for subagents. Right, because sessions can also just have general use which subagents themselves are tools, so then my distinguishing between those things is important. The idea would be to be able to visualize when a session is using multiple subagents and no subagents themselves are using tools, like being able to have a visual stream of that. And the idea is you're running multiple Cloud Code instances, multiple Cloud Code sessions. And each session is doing something different.

Okay, moving on to the live event feed. I like that it has a pause button, I like that the filters are drop-downs. One note about that though is that the drop-downs do need to support multiple selections, so like events. That needs to be a drop-down where you can either have all events or check one or multiple events. So if you wanted to see all tool use and notifications in the event feed, for eg., that would be necessary. Then yeah, like the sessions drop-down there, there's also a case to be made about that supporting multi-select and then also figuring out what the right information to show about a session is. I don't know if the session ID is particularly helpful. Then there will also be some project information about like the working directory for each session and the Git repo if it's available, so just like the Git information should be available and that would allow a user to filter by a particular project (in a folder or based on a root sort of repo) and see all branches that are associated sessions with a particular project which could be useful as well. In terms of the actual event feed, I like that it's dense, I like that the session id is shortened. The table is not very well aligned, at least in the let's see if I make it wider, the table is not very well aligned and that's not great. The columns are not aligned.But overall, I like that it's dense. We'll see if other variants do a better job with the color coding here. There's not a lot of color coding. Everything is just kind of one-note in here.

Variant 2:
Okay, looking at variant two. Ah, okay. There we go. Oh, this is interesting. Okay. Okay, so looking at variant two, there's a lot of stuff going on here. So I like the header, it's nice and condensed. This one skips the horizontal stream altogether and goes for a sidebar approach. It looks like visualizing the sub-agents is prioritized which is cool. I guess the top-level container is a session, I'm guessing? So yeah, I'm looking at the left sidebar. I actually like that the sessions are listed out here. I think that does a good job of handling the density. I would probably want to change the session information that's shown on the little button container. I do like that you can drill down into sub-agents and see what the sub-agents are doing. I think that that would be cool if that were automatic - the containers would automatically expand if there's sub-agents under there. Also, any instances that are awaiting input would bubble up to the top of this sidebar list. That would be really cool. Instead of the 3 sessions waiting and put the kind of like floating more notification there, that would be good to have them bubble up in that sidebar.So then looking at the live event feed, this looks really cool. It's very well aligned, it's very readable and scannable. It's not immediately obvious what the color coding is about. But I like that there's some indentation here in trying to capture these groupings of events. So tool use was the example that I gave where there's at least a pre-tool use and a post-tool use. And so capturing or attempting to capture that in here with some indentation is really interesting. And I feel like maybe that could be explored more.

I also wonder if in this layout, there's a case for being able to pin one or more events to the top. I'm thinking in particular about sub-agents who are then going to have event streams. But maybe that's the case for filtering, filtering by the sub-agent. So I could see a case where in this left sidebar, if you had like you could click on a session and have the live event feed filter for that session, but then one one sub-agent spawn you could click on one or more sub-agents and have the live feed filter by those sub-agents. So you could select multiple things in the left sidebar and have them filter out have that be filtering for the right sidebar. But there's a lot to like here in this feed.

Variant 3:
Just waiting for variant three to load okay there we go um all lots of like here um this looks similar to variant one in like the the header and like how that's uh condensed i like the color coding of the like waiting and active um little kind of deal there um you know again like all the data should be right aligned in the header um but this we move on to this kind of like timeline stream kind of view um which is uh i'm having a hard time like there's a lot to like and then i also just like generally don't understand what i'm looking at um so i like that the the instances all kind of have swim lanes um but then there's kind of like these uh there's like these little contained uh groups of tools i guess and they're all color-coded and like the container is color-coded the tools are color-coded with like letters and there's like some little icons in there so i'd like i don't really understand what any of that means um and i think there's yeah there's tooltip so when you hover over them you can you can see so i hover over the e that's for edit if i hover over the r that's for read um g for prep okay so that's that's interesting um i think iconography could could help there um but i do like kind of like this idea of swimlanes um it's not streaming um so i would be interested to see what this looks like you know as i would be interested to see what this looks like with dynamic you know some sort of dynamic activity um because i i guess this is supposed to you know this is supposed to move as more events kind of show up in this in this feed i also think that the the like indentation concept from uh the second variant uh could be useful here for like subagents so you've got like the main session um and then like when that starts to spawn sub-agents like those would kind of be indented like an indented swimlane um and like get their own stream and then once the sub-agent completes it would sort of like like close and then you know be added to the main session stream um and you'd have to kind of figure out how to like condense the you know condense the sub-agent because the sub-agent will use you know lots and lots of tools you know it'll have you know maybe 30 40 maybe more tool calls in in one sub agent um and so figuring out how to condense condense that visually um and still make it useful um would be you know really helpfulAnd again, this is a case for clicking into something and having it either display a modal with the details. So if you were to click on a sub-agent, you could see all the tool calls and the tool history there, and then drill into the details of each one. Or clicking some other element and having it filter the event feed to show those particular things. 

I think I kind of think that there's a world where if this timeline stream was done right, it would be almost like more scannable than the live event feed. And you could kind of really toggle between these two views where this horizontal feed is very scannable, and then the live event feed you could use to drill down if you want it to filter by project, or if you just wanted more details about what's running. 

Yeah, I think that would be really interesting. 

Then maybe the only other thing I would say about this variant is in that swim lane view, indicating if a session or sub-agents go in here, but indicating in the first column in the leg swim lane name if that agent needs attention with a more prominent icon. The live event feed I think is pretty similar to other event feeds. This one is color-coded, which is nice. But it's overall pretty similar to the rest. 

Oh, then the last thing is that the height of this swim lane view is kind of static. Which I'm not sure if I like, but then if it was bouncing up and down and I was trying to view the live event feed, that might also be annoying. So maybe having it at a static height is desirable.

Variant 4:
All right variant four. So this is trying to really prioritize it looks like session status and like agent status. So like agents needing input is like extremely prominent at the top I'm not sure, I don't like how prominent it is, especially like each one having kind of its own row taking up a full row, these could have been more, these could have been much more condensed and this whole thing could have been one row. It's also red which it's a little more alarming than it needs to be so then moving down to the status board. I like this but I also think it takes up a lot of space and the variant that had the sidebar I think was the best display of like if you were going to do agent status like you know displaying them in the sidebar. In just like one column was it was best for scale. So then nothing really new about the event feed here and then pending response queue. That's like down at the bottom and I am if I hadn't scrolled I would not have even noticed it was there. I do like that the live event feed is contained in an area. And it's not just like infinitely scrolling down to the bottom of the screen. It's sort of contained within a field of view but then the pending response queue, one I don't know what this is and how it adds to the huge warnings at the top and two it's like very, very lost down at the bottom of the page. And like not prominent. Oh so then also I see this like option for like show only blocked agents which is interesting. It's yeah, I'd like this design is like trying to do too many different things to try and prioritize but I guess that was the goal right? Like to throw out a lot of options and then I could give feedback on which ones I liked. So yeah, interestingly, I don't really like any of them. So I would say this is my least favorite design so far because I feel like all of the elements were done better in previous designs.

Variant 5:
OK, variant five. What is going on here? Same condensed header, which is nice. I guess these elements at the top are sessions that need input. Which again, like this is much more condensed and I like the yellow coloring that's like not as alarmist as the last one. It's much more condensed so I'm actually not really too mad at the space that it takes up. So then, okay, moving on there's an event feed which okay this one is using straight up icons which I think could be useful if there was a consistent design language. This is using emojis which is just it's cool for quick design I think if we were gonna go with this icon view. Or we go to like the material icon set and use you know just a consistent design language that I don't think that emojis provides. Also of just like one line of icons, I don't think it's super useful and I also think that like with real data in multiple sessions that would get super dense to the point where like you just have like icons stacked on top of each other and like this I don't think this will scale this like horizontal line of icons. So then looking at the event feed this is kind of seems like it's trying to group things together in some way. Like the design of the table I like, I like the iconography, like I'd like the contrast here of like the tool name and then there was like a description in there which is cool. I'm not really sure what okay maybe this is like the session. It's like S1, S2 there's like a little kind of pill thing in here almost. Yeah okay so that's the session. The sessions aren't really identified that way but this one it looks like it looks like that's the last item in that column is maybe a get branch which is cool. I do like that and there's also like a lot of space in this table. There's a lot of space to the right of the last column so there could be you know potentially more information in here which would be super cool. I don't really understand the grouping because there's like a there's like a feed and the feed keeps adding on top of the like the grouping but like and the feed's not color coded but the grouping is so yeah I'm not really sure I I'm not really sure I understand this. I do like the one way that the items look within the grouping like the way that they're color-coded and even the table names kind of have or sorry the table rows even have like a thing and I guess that's maybe like the yellow is something that's weighting yeah user confirmation and maybe that's why they're like grouped by like I feel like these would these groups should be at the top and then like kind of pinned to the top if they're like awaiting input and that's the point behind grouping them um that would be kind of a better pattern there um but overall like not bad.

Variant 6:
Variant 6 is super minimal. I think this would work really well for a mobile view, but for the Dashboard, it's too minimal. It does work really well for a mobile view or even like a Chrome plug-in or some minimal container view. I think the information that it chose to bubble up and the way that it chose to bubble it up is actually pretty good. Yeah, I just am not really at this use case yet. So I don't know that it works for the main Dashboard, but there's a lot to like here for mobile or more condensed view.
