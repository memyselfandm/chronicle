Variant 1:
- Header: Good
- Don't like the eye icon as the toggle for the activity timeline
- I don't know what this target button does
- Zoom. I don't think the activity timeline needs zoom. It should just find a scale and get in there
Let's see what else. Okay, the session sidebar has like an X on it. And I guess that's to clear the selection. But that's very unclear because I don't know, okay, here's the button to close the sidebar. Okay, yeah, that's a little confusing. Like that there's a search there. I could be useful if sessions grows. We've got project-based folders, which is good. Awaiting input is bubbled up to the top. So it was a couple of minor design issues. But all in all, the sidebar is pretty dialed in to my feedback.

The activity timeline. I don't not sure that this is it. Yeah, this is not the best version of swim lanes that I've seen, so not this one. And then we've got the event feed. Some CSS issues. This is like a way too condensed to the point where some of the columns are not wide enough, that's weird. And then it's kind of the event types and sessions like filter as like a multi-select. I don't like this, I would rather it be like an actual multi-select drop-down component that you can do with just a mouse instead of having to hold down Ctrl or Cmd to select multiple things in here because it's also just not clear that you can select multiple things and this whole filter thing takes up way too much space, so I don't like this. I don't know if it's supposed to be styled and maybe the style sheets just aren't working, but yeah, in this state, I do not like it. Okay, so that's variant one.

Okay, so I'm taking another look at variant one now that the I had the agents go back and re-revised the CSS. And it actually doesn't really look like much has changed. So maybe it was intentional in a sense that how it did things. Yeah, the sidebar actually works in this one, which is cool. Not not a lot has changed. I think my feedback remains the same even in the revised version.

Variant 2:
Okay, varying it to. Again some styling issues in the sidebar. Got all projects, all statuses look like it's supposed to have a style but it doesn't work. Also the sidebar doesn't visual like when you toggle the sidebar it slides out but the rest of the page doesn't compensate. So yeah I wonder if there's just like some issues with the style sheet in some of these. Yeah. But okay, skipping all that activity timeline condenses. I like this toggle switch that's nice. The icons here like the little boxes are visually good. Like they are in the style that I want them to be in. The design of this timeline I think is almost there but again I wonder if there's just like a CSS issue here that's causing this to not render the way that it's supposed to because the like the titles of the sessions I think are just like wrapping in a way that makes this really hard to read. So there's like some styling issues that need to be sorted out there.

Event feed again we got another like really multi-select kind of box that's unstyled and it doesn't need to be hidden, it's actually not too bad where it is. Yeah but yeah I wonder if that could just be like a tool tip somewhere that like you know pops like a rich tool tip that has the key in it and give us that little bit of space back on the page.

Okay so then going back to the event feed this is nice. It's not bad in terms of contrast. I still like the versions of this where it's color coded. The indentation is nice for the subagents. I don't like the subagent text is a bit great out. Yeah I don't like that at the subagents are a bit great out because it's kind of makes it look like they're done or disabled or something, or like just generally not as important. When actually the subagents are doing is important.

All right, and coming back to variant two, looking back at variant two after the CSS has been updated, in some ways it actually looks worse. Variant two did not get fixed for anything. I think it's a little bit more broken, and I still don't like it.

Variant 3:
All right, looking at variant three. Let's see what we got here. Header looks good. Sidebar, the sidebar toggle in this one actually works and it works well. This one has search sessions in the sidebar as well. It has got a pretty complex filter system here. I don't know if this filter thing is supposed to be collapsible, but right now it looks to be just kind of in a container, a fixed size container in the sidebar which I don't like if it was collapsible then that would be cool. I like the design of the filters that's actually pretty nice but again like this filter thing needs to be collapsible because it's taking up way too much space.

So then going down to like the project view, the projects don't collapse which I think I liked it better when they collapsed, yeah when sessions collapse under projects. Either that or just making them a little bit more, making the sessions under the projects a little bit smaller. Also I just like the width of the sidebar and like the way that this project title is laid out with the branch name in it. I like the layout of that component, but it doesn't work well in the sidebar. Like the text is wrapping a lot, so I'd rather see the title of the project on one line and then the branch. I think this is on the next line as it's like subtext, that would be a lot better.

Then the individual sessions are like much better. Those actually look pretty good. I kind of wonder if like the icon's changing based on what the thing is currently doing. I kind of wonder if that would get to be too busy. But yeah, that's just worth considering - is that like a whole lot of like changing icons in the sidebar based on what task is going on is one just like a lot of javascript that's running so it could affect performance, and two it's just like visually overwhelming.
So then, all right, looking at the timeline view, that one toggles. It's not very clear that the timeline icon toggles the thing open and closed. I think it was variant two that just had like a, you know, pretty common like window shade you know little carrot to make it go up and down. The target icon here has words next to it so that's to like focus on now. Again like I yeah I could I guess I could see a case where you could horizontally scroll the timeline but back some some amount of time and it would like retain those events and then you'd have a button that would you know bring it back to live and like automatically scrolling. So, you know, essentially the first column of the swim lanes would that indicates like the project or or like indicates the session or the sub agent would stay fixed and then you could scroll the timeline of events. Horizontally. And when you scrolled the timeline it would stop auto scrolling and then you could hit that like little target or now button to bring it back to you know, bring it back to the edge and start auto scrolling again. So like yeah like if that could be a good good pattern going into the event feed.

I'm noticing that I as for this event feed either like it where there's like no color and everything is just like how this one is where it's just like white text with white icons. And just like there's this little green dot next to everything which I don't I don't know what that dot is indicating But you know, there's like maybe just that one little pop of color or where everything like everything is actually color coded. Yeah, there's, there's been some variance where there's been a lot more intentional use of color in different ways. Like the row backgrounds or a little highlight at the front of the row and then tool names and just like different components where the color has been very intentionally used to help this thing be scanable.

And then yeah so I guess the filters would work from the left side bar if you wanted to filter the event feed, which is cool. Overall though this one is not bad this layout works really well. There's actually like pretty good layout minus the couple of little issues that I've that I've seen in here.

Variant 4:
Moving on to variant four. CSS here is broken. Yeah, it's got, it's got pagination at the bottom which for a live feed I'm not sure that works. Yeah, I'm not sure that the pagination works here. I don't know that it's really necessary. The activity timeline is broken. I don't see any activities in it. The sidebar toggle is, I guess it's like next to the sidebar. Yeah, I'm not so sure about that. The CSS is also broken for the sidebar like projects like they're all just kind of sitting on top of each other. So yeah, there's that. The the filters are unstyled. It's like unstyled lists selects. Yeah, this I don't know, I think this design is a little too broken to give feedback on. It has like a condensed view toggle but I don't really know what it does yeah. It's got two like throughput indicators which I think are the same in the header. Yeah, it's like literally duplicated throughput indicator. Not sure I like that. I do kind of sort of like the like little line, the little tiny line graph indicator of throughput. I kinda sorta like that. That could be an interesting visual for the header um but maybe like to the far right um yeah or maybe even then the like activity timeline header um but I don't know maybe this iteration was like not focused on the activity timeline so it didn't actually create one um maybe it was focused on the event feed which I don't uh I guess the the layout of the event feed like it's a nice clean looking table um but again like the use of color here is not great um and also the use of the space is not great like there's like a details column that's just long. Um and I don't know if like the date is missing or you know what the deal is, but there's just like not a lot of information in there. It's more so just like the the concise description of the tool or or of the tool that's being used or of the event um but there's you know no okay I see this session is in there um but yeah like adding a column for like uh you know the project and you know maybe the git branch or like whatever other information is available like this session as a as a is one of the first columns. Like again title where it's like the folder or the git branch or something, then that's like helpful. But yeah, like, I'm not too stoked about this, this little hovering, like Q depth memory. I don't know if that's like for the application itself. Like events cached. I mean, I guess, like, that would be nice in like a, you know, like a settings mode. Total or something that you could pull up to just like see the stats on the dashboard application. If you wanted to like see what its performance was um but yeah like as just like hovering on the page all the time don't like it.

Variant 5:
Okay, so variant five is supposed to be kind of taking all four variants and putting them together. In retrospect, just having this kind of automatically kick off without some feedback in between was probably not a good idea. But let's see. So in the header it's got this like throughput indicator line chart, and I actually like the way that it did this component here. I don't know that it needs to be kind of like in this blue kind of square background, but it's having the chart next to, you know, the icon, the numerical data with like the throughput and then the chart is like that. I like the layout of that component. Overall, like overall the header here is nice. The timeline is like not rendering. There's no nothing in the timeline. I don't know if there's supposed to be something in the timeline but there's not. bar. It has like some preset filters which is interesting and then has a condensed mode which doesn't really do a whole lot of condensing. So I like the condensed mode for the sidebar. I don't really think that that's helpful. The or whatever this is in the sidebar it's not really organized by project which I don't like. I don't like this design pattern for the sidebar; it is bubbling up the weighting things to the top which I do like, but then yeah, some of the other designs just had a little bit more structure here which I liked. The event feed is actually OK. The table needs better spacing, and I actually liked some of the other designs where this table actually had a header to know what each of these columns are. But yeah, the table needs better spacing. Some of the CSS here is broken, and there's like some nice little pops of color in just the icons, so that's cool. This filter is the most correct filter that there has been, so it's like filter button you click it and it's got a list of checkboxes that you can turn on and off. Oh and then when you toggle them it shows you what filters you have active in the title bar which is a little strange because it's like disconnected from the filter button. It's like it's completely on the other side of the screen from the filter button. So I would probably want to see that combined, like when you have event types filtered (the Event Types button). The filter button itself shows you that like you have 5 out of 9 or however many, and then if you have them all selected, then it doesn't show you anything, just like you have them all selected. It just says Event Types goes back to default state.

Variant 6:
Okay, and the final variant which is variant 6. Okay the sidebar works. Yeah, so this one has like a search bar. The filter, you can click filters and it like has some preset filters that collapse. I like that condensed view, again like doesn't really do anything here. I would actually prefer that the sidebar just always be in this more condensed view because it's actually not doing a whole lot of condensing. And then the X button I guess clears all the filters. Yeah, but then how do you multi-select? Can you like okay you can like Command click to multi-select in here which is nice and then you can clear. Okay that is cool let's see. Okay there we go!

So then moving on to the timeline or actually let me look at the header. This is this one has the like little throughput with the graph that's cool um it actually looks good. Again I want all these data components to be right-aligned in the header. Yeah, and so let's close the sidebar and then look at the activity timeline. I do not like the design of the icons for the swimlanes in this timeline um it's also got a horizontal scroll bar for no reason um so that that's probably just styling like CSS it needs to be dialed in. But I can scroll vertically I guess it's just doubling up things that need notifications or things that need attention to the top which is cool, but the actual like icons in the swimlane I do not like. Like the kind of gray color for all the icons is just like very flat where I liked the other designs where these were like color-coded. I also like the square icons more than I like the circle icons here. So there's still some work to be done here. Event feed uh so you got kind of like two checkboxes: notifications only and then some other checkbox that I don't know what it does. This table has headers which I like, but then the CSS is still a little broken here where there's like not enough spacing between each of these columns. So that needs work.
