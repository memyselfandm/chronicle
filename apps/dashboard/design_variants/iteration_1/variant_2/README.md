# Chronicle Dashboard - Variant 2: Minimalist Consolidation

## Design Philosophy

This variant focuses on **intelligent event consolidation** and **minimalist aesthetics** to reduce cognitive load while maintaining essential monitoring capabilities. The design emphasizes clean visual hierarchy, generous negative space, and smart grouping of related events.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Event Consolidation
- **Rapid Sequence Detection**: Groups events of the same type occurring within 5 seconds into single consolidated rows
- **Expandable Details**: Click consolidated events to see individual sub-events with timestamps
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear count badges and expand/collapse indicators for consolidated events
- **Smart Grouping**: Reduces visual noise by showing "5 tool uses in 2s" instead of 5 separate rows

### Minimalist Visual Design
- **Dark Theme**: Low-contrast background (#0a0a0a) with strategic use of negative space
- **Clean Typography**: Inter font family with careful weight hierarchy
- **Subtle Indicators**: 8px status dots with soft glows, minimal color palette
- **Grid Layout**: Balanced three-column header layout with centered branding

### Sparkline Chart
- **10-minute Timeline**: Shows activity over the last 10 minutes in 10-second intervals
- **Multiple Event Types**: Color-coded sparklines for tool use, user input, and system events
- **Smooth Rendering**: Canvas-based rendering with glow effects and anti-aliased lines
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously shifts to show latest activity

### Enhanced UX
- **Connection Status**: Live status indicator with visual feedback
- **Session Counter**: Dynamic badge showing active sessions awaiting input
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter events by type while maintaining consolidation logic
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and tablet screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Event Consolidation Algorithm
```javascript
// Groups events by type within 5-second windows
// Maintains original timestamps for sub-events
// Provides expand/collapse functionality
```

### Chart Technology
- HTML5 Canvas with high-DPI support
- Multiple sparkline overlays for different event types
- Smooth animations and glow effects
- Real-time data updates every 5 seconds

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient DOM updates for event feed
- Canvas rendering optimizations
- Smart re-rendering only when necessary
- Minimal memory footprint for event storage

## Design Decisions

1. **Consolidation Over Detail**: Prioritizes overview understanding over individual event inspection
2. **Negative Space**: Uses generous whitespace to prevent visual overwhelm
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Detailed information available on-demand through expansion
4. **Subtle Animations**: Fade-in effects and smooth transitions maintain polish without distraction
5. **Color Restraint**: Limited palette focuses attention on status and event types

## Use Cases

This variant works best for:
- **High-volume environments** where event consolidation provides clarity
- **Monitoring scenarios** where patterns matter more than individual events
- **Users who prefer** clean, uncluttered interfaces
- **Dashboard displays** where cognitive load reduction is priority

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with Canvas support
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet
- High-DPI display optimization
- Keyboard accessibility for interactive elements
