# Iteration 1 Feedback Summary

## Overall Themes
- Dark theme should be maintained (variants 1, 2, 3 did this well)
- Event density and information display from variant 1 is preferred
- Graph/chart visualizations in current form are not useful
- Need better support for scaling to multiple Claude Code instances
- Focus should be on productivity and unblocking agents, not pattern analysis

## Variant-Specific Feedback

### Variant 1 ✅ (Best Overall)
**Strengths:**
- Excellent visual consolidation and density
- Condensed live event feed is well-designed
- Tool names shown in event rows (critical feature)
- Sessions awaiting input prominently displayed
- Most information-rich event rows

**Concerns:**
- Sessions awaiting input might not need full horizontal width
- Bar chart format not useful for showing event counts

### Variant 2 ⭐ (Good Concepts)
**Strengths:**
- Clean, minimal header design (could be thinner)
- Filters at top of event feed (needed feature)
- Concept of consolidating events is good

**Concerns:**
- Events don't show enough information compared to variant 1
- Time-based consolidation too simplistic - should group by lifecycle (pre/post tool use pairs)
- Graph visualization not useful
- Need better sub-agent association/visualization

### Variant 3 ⭐ (Mixed)
**Strengths:**
- Color coding for visual scanning
- Tool names displayed
- Filters present (should be dropdown)
- Pause button is useful
- Time filter controls
- Good row design with session tags

**Concerns:**
- Header layout poor (should be title left, data right)
- Event duration metric not valuable for header
- Events per minute questionable value
- Less information than variant 1 rows

### Variant 4 ❌ (Not Suitable)
**Strengths:**
- Event categories as dropdown is good

**Concerns:**
- Components too large for local dev machine use
- Better suited for office radiator screen
- Nothing stands out from previous variants
- High contrast not the target use case

### Variant 5 ❌ (Doesn't Scale)
**Strengths:**
- Concept of sessions at a glance is interesting
- Session status indicators (active/waiting)

**Concerns:**
- Large session cards won't scale to 10-30 instances
- Event timeline cards too big for event density
- Timeline should use icons/minimal characters, not cards with text
- Event density concept not useful
- Tool name changes in active sessions could be too busy

### Variant 6 ❌ (Reject)
**Strengths:**
- None noted

**Concerns:**
- Two sidebars unnecessary
- Pattern analysis and anomaly detection not relevant
- Heat map incomprehensible
- Active sessions done better in other variants
- Overall approach misses the focus on productivity

## Key Requirements for Iteration 2

### Must Have
1. **Dense event rows** like variant 1 with tool names visible
2. **Dropdown filters** for event types
3. **Sessions awaiting input** indicator (but more compact)
4. **Dark theme** maintained
5. **Support for scaling** to 10-30 Claude Code instances

### Should Have
1. **Event lifecycle grouping** (pre/post tool use pairs)
2. **Sub-agent association** in event feed
3. **Minimal header** like variant 2 but thinner
4. **Pause button** for event feed
5. **Time filter controls**

### Graph/Timeline Replacement
Instead of bar charts showing event counts, the horizontal visualization should show:
- **Tool use visualization**
- **Sub-agent activity**
- **Prompt cycles** (user prompt → associated stop event)
- **Iconography** instead of text for density
- **Minimal characters** for high throughput scenarios

### Focus
The dashboard's primary purpose is:
- Monitor what agents/Claude Code instances are doing
- Identify which instances need input to be unblocked
- Maintain productivity across multiple instances
- NOT pattern analysis or anomaly detection
