Variant 1:
Okay, looking at variant one. I really like how visually consolidated this is. Live event view is nice and condensed. I love that the tool uses lines show the name of the tool. That's awesome. See yeah I just really like the look of the live event feed here.
Other things I like about this design are:
- I like that it shows the sessions awaiting input prominently.
- I don't have some other thoughts about whether that needs to take up a full horizontal space across the page.
- I like the event activity stream. I like the way that it looks. I think it matches what I described.
Just like the graph and way that it's structured, but as I'm looking at it though, I don't actually think that the graph in that form is very useful. I think that the horizontal event feed is probably best used for visualizing tool use and visualizing sub-agents and visualizing prompt cycles. Like, when the user submits a prompt all the way through the associated stop event for that prompt and then like the sub-agents somehow visualizing that and that horizontal feed I think is much better use. But like the way that the bar charts are stacked up and they show like the number of notification events I don't think is particularly useful.

Variant 2:
Okay, looking at variant two. I also like this event feed, even though it's not as dense as variant one. It is much more consolidated than the current live version of the app. The individual Yeah, I'm just looking at actually the events in here are not actual clock code events. But the yeah, like the events in the event feed don't actually show as much information as variant one. The kind of like rolling up seven tool uses or you know multiple tool uses into one line. I think conceptually like the actual design component is cool. But the way that I would want to roll up separate events into one line is a little bit more specific than time so like there are groups of events like the pre-tool use and post-tool use like that is a full like tool use life cycle that could be sort of rolled up into one event also like pre-tool use with a notification and then post-tool use. There's like you know there's those just combinations of those events that represent like kind of certain life cycles. Like for a sub-agent, like a sub-agent looks like a pre-tool use for task, the task tool and the task tool is what launches a sub-agent but then when the sub agent is done then it fires a sub agent stop hook. And not a well actually it might still fire a post-tool use hook I'm not sure. But there's you know there's some nuance there and to figuring that out and what I would really like to do if the data in Claude code supports it is be able to when a sub agent launches I wanna associate all the I want to have all the tool uses for the sub agent associated with that sub agent. So they would like still show up in the feed but have some kind of indication of the sub agent in there. And this is for the the more like tabular line-by-line event feed not the the sort of horizontal graph stream thing that goes for variant 2 I don't like this graph it just it doesn't do it for me I like it's just not useful I do like in go so like going back to the tabular event feed I do like that it has filters at the top. And filters is definitely something that needs to be like added to the main application. Maybe some of the other designs will have some inspiration about how to do that. The header for variant 2 is actually pretty nice. It's very like it's very minimal I think it could probably stand to be a little bit thinner, less tall, so that's yeah that's what I'm kinda thinking there but I like that effect.

Variant 3:
Okay variant three um what do we have going on here the header for variant three is pretty information dense um but good I do not like the way that it's laid out I would prefer that the title be left aligned um and then all of the data be right aligned yeah it's just it's very dense uh events per minute is an interesting metric I guess I don't know if I like events per minute um but I don't know if I don't like it either then uh event duration I don't think is a valuable metric certainly not valuable enough to have in the header um so then moving down to active sessions I do like the idea of active sessions being up um just generally being surrogate for some where I think this would be nice as a filter so just like more consolidated as a filter the live event activity the only thing I really like about this is the time filter and I generally like the size of it and then for the live event feed uh I like the filters but I think that they should be a drop down um and then I like the pause button I do like the size, shape, and design of these individual rows um like I like how they are visually scannable because of the color codes but I also think that the variant one rows had much more information um I like the event roles, I like the session tags, I like that it shows the tool name that's awesome just in general the color coding is good there so yeah it's variant three, overall pretty good I also like that it sticks with the dark theme um variants one and two also stuck with the dark theme of the original app and I think that it looks really good that the addition of the color in the individual events is really nice for variant three.

Variant 4:
Variant 4 is just OK. I'm not really sure anything stands out about it from the previous three variants. I think that it nails the high contrast thing well, but I'm not really sure that high contrast is really the use case that I'm aiming for. It's also very big. Like it's just like the components are very big and I feel like this would work well for like a radiator screen in an office or something like that. But for the use case to run this locally on your dev machine, I don't think this works very well.

I do like in the recent event stream that the event categories is a dropdown. I do like that.

Variant 5:
Variant five. Also. What do I like about this? I do like the general concept of of how active sessions is organized. Although I worried that if this sort of scales up to if you are monitoring, yes, and automated your clock code at scale where you'd have you know, maybe 1020 30 instances of clock code running that could be if you're monitoring this for like a team or an organization that could be tricky in this this configuration which is which is possible in any use case that I do want to support So I don't know if you know having these kind of like fairly large cards for sessions under the active sessions section works, but I do kind of like the concept of having the sessions at a glance. And then each one sort of indicating its its status of like its activity. or it's waiting although having active on a card under active sessions is a little redundant but I understand the need to differentiate it from from waiting. I see the I see the tool name in the in the active session card and the sessions are are active, then that would be sort of changing which might be a little like a little busy especially if you're running more than one of these so yeah I don't know what form this takes or if it even takes a form but the more I think about it I don't know. It will work event density timeline I think another design tried to do this and I don't I don't really like the concept of event density. um Yeah I've already sort of given an idea of what that what the timeline view could look like um or the density or this like horizontal graph feed and so moving on to the event timeline. This this the way that this view is set up it's just not going to support the density of events because even one Cloud Code instance running multiple subagents will generate so many tool use events like the event throughput is just too high for this view to support like the cards are really big I do like that they're color-coded but like I have this view is kind of not the the event feed or even the the timeline that I'm going for in in the timeline view like the if events would not be would probably not have their like any any words really um I think it would be like iconography like very very minimal characters uh because of the density of information um so yeah that's that's my feedback on variant five.

Variant 6:
Variant 6, a lot going on here. The overall layout with the left and right sidebars and the larger main content area is interesting, but I don't know that it needs two sidebars. One sidebar might be enough because active sessions takes up a lot of space for not a lot of content. That could have been done much better horizontally in some of the other variants. Pattern analysis is not really the goal here, and anomaly detection is not really what's happening. The focus is on what your agents or cloud code instances are doing. Most of that's going to be tool use, and what cloud code instances need is input so that they're unblocked and being productive. Digging into individual things like pattern analysis isn't relevant. Active anomalies also aren't relevant, and active sessions was done better. I don't even understand what I'm looking at when I look at this heat map, and the live event stream was done better in other variants as well. Pretty much nix variant 6.
