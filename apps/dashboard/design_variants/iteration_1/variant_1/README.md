# Chronicle Dashboard - Ultra Dense Variant

## Design Rationale

This variant prioritizes **information density** and **glance-ability** for monitoring high-volume event streams (1000+ events/hour). Inspired by Bloomberg Terminal and professional financial monitoring systems.

## Key Design Decisions

### Ultra-Thin Event Rows (22px height)
- **Rationale**: Maximize visible events without scrolling
- **Trade-off**: Reduced visual comfort for maximum information density
- **Benefit**: ~45 events visible simultaneously on standard screens

### Monospace Typography
- **Font**: Monaco/Menlo/Ubuntu Mono at 10-11px
- **Rationale**: Consistent character widths improve scanability
- **Bloomberg Influence**: Professional terminal aesthetic

### Color-Coded Event Types
- **Blue**: User prompts (queries, requests)
- **Green**: Tool usage (actions, operations) 
- **Red**: Errors (failures, issues)
- **Orange**: Notifications (awaiting input)
- **Left border accent**: Instant visual categorization

### Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart
- **Time Range**: Last 10 minutes in 10-second intervals
- **Stacking**: Event types stacked to show composition
- **Benefit**: Immediate pattern recognition of system activity

### Active Sessions Counter
- **Prominence**: Large, centered display
- **Context**: Focuses on sessions requiring user input
- **Color**: Orange to match notification events

## Performance Optimizations

### Virtual Scrolling Concept
- Renders only 200 most recent events for DOM performance
- Maintains smooth scrolling with 1000+ events in memory

### Canvas-Based Charts
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Smooth real-time updates without DOM manipulation

### Efficient Data Structures
- Sliding window for chart data (60 intervals max)
- Event queue with automatic pruning (1000 events max)

## Information Hierarchy

1. **Connection Status** - Critical system health (top-left)
2. **Active Sessions** - Primary actionable metric (prominent)
3. **Activity Graph** - Trend analysis (visual overview)
4. **Event Stream** - Detailed chronological data (scrollable)

## Target Use Cases

- **DevOps Monitoring**: Real-time system event tracking
- **Debug Sessions**: Rapid event pattern identification  
- **Performance Analysis**: High-frequency event correlation
- **Issue Triage**: Quick error detection in event streams

## Accessibility Considerations

Despite density focus:
- High contrast ratios maintained
- Consistent color coding system
- Keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure preserved

This design trades visual comfort for maximum information throughput, suitable for expert users who need to monitor high-volume event streams efficiently.
