# Chronicle Dashboard - Variant 3: Data-Rich Display

## Design Rationale

This variant is designed for **power users** who need comprehensive visibility into Chronicle events without requiring additional clicks or navigation. Every piece of relevant information is displayed inline for maximum efficiency and observability.

## Key Features

### üìä **Comprehensive Header**
- **Connection Status**: Real-time latency monitoring with visual indicators
- **System Metrics**: Live events/minute, average duration, total events, and uptime
- **Detailed Subtitle**: Quick overview of system health and activity

### üîÑ **Active Sessions Overview**
- **Session Counter**: Prominent badge showing active session count
- **Session Preview Cards**: Inline display of session details including:
  - Session ID with color-coded identification
  - Project name and status
  - Start time and current state
  - Color-coded borders for easy visual distinction

### üìà **Live Event Graph**
- **Interactive Chart**: Real-time visualization of event activity over time
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Hover to see exact event counts per type per interval
- **Time Range Controls**: 5m, 15m, 1h views for different observation windows
- **Color-Coded Legend**: Visual mapping of event types to chart colors

### üìù **Comprehensive Event Feed**
- **Medium-Height Cards**: Optimized 40-50px rows for information density
- **Inline Details**: All critical information visible without expansion:
  - Precise timestamp
  - Event type with color-coded badges
  - Tool name (for tool events)
  - Parameter preview with smart truncation
  - Duration for post-tool events
  - Session ID snippet
- **Advanced Filtering**: Toggle filters by event type with visual feedback
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of new events with smooth animations

## Design Philosophy

### **Information Density over Simplicity**
This variant prioritizes showing maximum relevant information over minimalist design. Every pixel serves a purpose in providing observability.

### **No Modal Dependencies**
All event details are displayed inline. Users never need to click to see additional information, enabling rapid scanning and monitoring.

### **Visual Hierarchy through Color**
- Event types use distinct colors for instant recognition
- Session identification through consistent color coding
- Status indicators use semantic colors (green=good, red=error, yellow=warning)

### **Power User Efficiency**
- Keyboard-like information density
- Monospace fonts for precise data alignment
- Quick-scan layouts with consistent positioning
- Minimal interaction required for maximum information consumption

## Technical Implementation

### **Real-time Simulation**
- Events generated every 2-5 seconds with realistic variety
- Chart updates automatically with smooth transitions
- System metrics calculated from actual event data

### **Responsive Design**
- Maintains information density on smaller screens
- Graceful degradation of layout complexity
- Preserves critical information at all viewport sizes

### **Performance Considerations**
- Event feed limited to recent 50 events for optimal rendering
- Chart data optimized for 15-minute rolling windows
- Efficient DOM updates to prevent performance degradation

## Use Cases

This variant is ideal for:
- **Development Teams**: Monitoring Claude Code usage across projects
- **System Administrators**: Observing tool performance and error patterns  
- **Power Users**: Debugging session issues and understanding workflow patterns
- **Analytics**: Gathering insights from comprehensive event visibility
