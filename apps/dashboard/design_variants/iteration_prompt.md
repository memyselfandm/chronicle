lets run iteration 3 and create 3 new variants; focusing on creating a refined core design using the feedback from iterations 1 and 2:
1. look at the current design in the            
screenshots provided in                         
ai_context/screenshots\                         
2. thoroughly review the current frontend       
deisgn architecture in apps/dashboard\
3. review the feedback from previous iterations:
- @apps/dashboard/design_variants/iteration_1/feedback_summary.md
- @apps/dashboard/design_variants/iteration_2/feedback_summary.md
*Note:* Iteration 2's feedback document also includes important data model information.
4. create a folder structure for the design     
variations in `apps/dashboard/design_variants/iteration_3`:                              
- add a folder for each variant `variant_N`     
where N is the single digit number of the       
variant (e.g. variant_3)                 
5. Here's the important part: set up 3
subagents, instructing each to create a         
**static** design variation based on the feedback
6. have each subagent focus on creating a core design based on all of the feedback given
7. Instruct each subagent to put their design   
into the associated `variants` subfolder.       
Instruct each agent that the complete design    
should live there and be independently          
viewable from that folder. It does *not* need   
to be a full copy of the dashboard, just a      
static design that i can provide fast feedback  
on\                                             
7. IMPORTANT: Launch ALL 3 sub-agents         
SIMULTANEOUSLY for maximum design efficiency.\  
8. when they are all done, report back to me    
so i can provide feedback.                      


Iteration 4:

next: iteration 4. iteration 4 will focus on creating a final core design, and have less variation between subagents.
I4 instructions:
1. look at the current design in the            
screenshots provided in                         
ai_context/screenshots\                         
2. thoroughly review the current frontend       
deisgn architecture in apps/dashboard\
3. read the guidance: @apps/dashboard/design_variants/consolidated_guidance.md
4. create a folder structure for the design     
variations in `apps/dashboard/design_variants/iteration_4`:                              
- add a folder for each variant `variant_N`     
where N is the single digit number of the       
variant (e.g. variant_3)                 
5. Here's the important part: set up 4
subagents, instructing each to create a         
**static** design variation based on the guidance
6. have each subagent focus on creating a refined, final draft design
7. Instruct each subagent to put their design   
into the associated `variants_` subfolder.       
Instruct each agent that the complete design    
should live there and be independently          
viewable from that folder. It does *not* need   
to be a full copy of the dashboard, just a      
static design that i can provide fast feedback  
on\                                             
7. IMPORTANT: Launch ALL 4 sub-agents         
SIMULTANEOUSLY for maximum design efficiency.\  
8. when they are all done, report back to me    
so i can provide feedback.
