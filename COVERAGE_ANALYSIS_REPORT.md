# Test Coverage Analysis Report - Sprint Agent 2
**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Agent**: Principal Software Engineer - Testing & Coverage Analysis  
**Context**: Post-Consolidation Coverage Validation (Chore 12)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes test coverage across the Chronicle codebase after the completion of Sprints 1-4 consolidation work. **Critical coverage gaps and import issues were discovered** that require immediate attention for production readiness.

### Key Findings
- **Hooks App**: 17% coverage (CRITICAL - needs significant improvement)
- **Dashboard App**: 68.92% coverage (Good baseline, some gaps)
- **Consolidation Impact**: Import paths broken, tests need updates
- **Infrastructure**: Coverage tooling functional, tests runnable after fixes

   - user_prompt_submit.py (126 lines)
   - post_tool_use.py (187 lines)
   - pre_tool_use.py (141 lines)
   - notification.py (115 lines)
   - All other hooks completely untested

2. **Database Integration (28% coverage)**
   - Connection handling untested
   - Error scenarios uncovered
   - Transaction logic missing

3. **Security Module (30% coverage)**
   - Input validation gaps
   - Path traversal protection untested
   - Data sanitization incomplete

#### Import Issues Fixed
- Updated 6+ test files with correct `src.lib.*` paths
- Fixed sys.path references from core to lib
- Resolved base_hook import patterns
- Installed missing dependencies (psutil, aiosqlite)

### Apps/Dashboard Coverage (68.92% - GOOD)

#### Module Breakdown
| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Components** | 84.76% | Good |
| **Hooks** | 26.08% | Poor |
| **Lib** | 66.99% | Good |
| **Types** | 100% | Excellent |

#### Component Coverage (Strong)
- EventCard.tsx: 94.11%
- EventFeed.tsx: 94.44%
- Header.tsx: 100%
- EventDetailModal.tsx: 79.16%
- EventFilter.tsx: 72.22%

#### Critical Dashboard Gaps
1. **Supabase Connection (4.14% coverage)**
   - Real-time subscription handling
   - Connection failure scenarios
   - Reconnection logic

2. **Event Hooks (26.08% coverage)**
   - useEvents.ts: 21.56%
   - Real-time data handling
   - Error boundary integration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 5)

#### 1. Fix Remaining Import Issues
```bash
# Remaining broken tests to fix:
- test_performance_optimization.py (missing psutil)
- test_backward_compatibility.py (module path issues)
- UV scripts (missing env_loader)
```

#### 2. Critical Coverage Improvements
**Priority 1: Hook Execution Testing**
```bash
# Create integration tests for:
- session_start.py
- user_prompt_submit.py  
- post_tool_use.py
- pre_tool_use.py
```

**Priority 2: Database Integration**
```bash
# Test scenarios:
- Connection establishment
- Error handling
- Transaction rollback
- Retry logic
```

**Priority 3: Dashboard Real-time**
```bash
# Test coverage for:
- useSupabaseConnection.ts
- Real-time subscription handling
- Connection failure recovery
```

### Medium-term Goals

#### Coverage Targets
- **Hooks App**: Increase from 17% to 60% minimum
- **Dashboard App**: Increase from 68.92% to 80% minimum
- **Critical paths**: 90%+ coverage for core functionality

#### Test Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Automated Coverage Reports**
   - Add coverage thresholds to CI/CD
   - Generate coverage badges
   - Track coverage trends

2. **Test Organization**
   - Standardize test patterns
   - Create test utilities
   - Mock shared dependencies

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Install missing dependencies (psutil)
   - Enable performance benchmarks
   - Monitor 100ms Claude Code requirement

### Production Readiness Checklist

#### Must Fix Before Production
- [ ] Hook execution modules have >50% coverage
- [ ] Database error scenarios tested
- [ ] Supabase connection handling tested
- [ ] All import issues resolved
- [ ] Critical user paths have >80% coverage

#### Should Fix Soon
- [ ] Security module >70% coverage
- [ ] Performance monitoring tested
- [ ] Real-time error scenarios covered
- [ ] Configuration edge cases tested

## Impact Assessment

### Consolidation Success
âœ… **Infrastructure Working**: Coverage tools functional  
âœ… **Import Fixes Applied**: Core consolidation import issues resolved  
âœ… **Baseline Established**: Clear coverage metrics captured  

### Critical Risks
ðŸš¨ **Production Risk**: 0% coverage on hook execution  
ðŸš¨ **Integration Risk**: Database scenarios untested  
ðŸš¨ **Reliability Risk**: Real-time connection handling gaps  

### Sprint 7 Validation
The Sprint 7 reported 96.6% test success rate appears to be based on **test execution**, not coverage. Our analysis shows significant **coverage gaps** that could impact production reliability.

## Conclusion

While the consolidation work (Sprints 1-4) successfully merged core/lib directories, **test coverage validation reveals critical gaps** requiring immediate attention. The 17% hooks coverage and missing hook execution tests represent significant production risks.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize test coverage improvements in Sprint 5 before declaring production readiness.
